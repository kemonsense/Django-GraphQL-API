# A simple Django GraphQL API Integration
 GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

Just run the below command <br>
$ pip install graphene-django

And then run the development server <br>
$ python manage.py runserver
